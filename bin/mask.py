"""Mask the center of each amplicon to simulate the unsequenced gap
between non-overlapping paired-end reads.
single ends can also be set. For single ends , there are no 'N' replacements at the end.

Keeps read_length bases at each end and replaces the middle with Ns.
Amplicons short enough for the two reads to overlap (length <= 2 * read_length)
are left unchanged, so short markers drop out of the experiment on their own.
